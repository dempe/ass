# Ass
(Yet) Another Static Site (Generator)

> When you assume, you make an ass out of me and you.

-- Sir Isaac Newton (I think)

# Goals

* Ass assumes as little as possible about your site.
  * You place your files in the `content` directory how you want them.
  * Don't worry, you can still define a `posts` directory and make posts like `ass new post trip-to-cuba`.
* Simplicity
* Etc.

# Command Examples

* `ass new site workspace/my_blog`
* `ass new post why-you-should-use-kotlin`
